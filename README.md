## Description:
<div>
    A compiler for our language Shrek-- inspired by the DreamWorks Movie Shrek and extended universe. We hope to make coding more memorable by making references to the mistical world of Shrek. As Shrek fans, we also hope also to make coding more enjoyable for shrek fans by including references to the movies and also using some ogre dialect.
</div>


## Features:

<div>
    Shrekk-- is written using curly brace styling and borrows the idea of public and private identifiers from java. 
    
    Shrek--:
    enchanted x ~ 3
    
    Java:
    public int x = 3;
</div>
<div>
    Shrekk-- also uses pythonic list comprehensions (shout out https://lingojam.com/ShrekSlang). 
    
    Shrek--:
    <x fur x in list whitevur (condition)>
    
    Python:
    [x for x in list if (condition)]
</div>

## Examples:

    shilling = int
    enchanted = public
    cursed = private
    Donkey = String
    Pinoccio = boolean
    truth = true
    lie = false
    Ogre = Class
